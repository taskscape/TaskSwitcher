## FIXING THE TASKWITCHER HANGING ISSUE

The application is hanging because of issues with the Chrome tab detection functionality. Here are the steps to fix it:

### STEP 1: ADD LOGGING SYSTEM
1. Create the `Utilities` folder in the Core project
2. Add the `Logger.cs` file we created to the Core\Utilities folder
3. Add a reference to System.Diagnostics in any files that need it

### STEP 2: MODIFY MAINWINDOW.CS
1. Replace the MainWindow constructor with the one from `MainWindowInitialization.cs`
2. Replace the LoadData method with the one from `MainWindowLoadDataChanges.cs`
3. Replace the FormatWindowTitles method with the one from `MainWindowFormatTitlesChanges.cs`

### STEP 3: DISABLE CHROME TAB DETECTION (TEMPORARY)
For a quick fix, implement the code in `DisableChromeTabDetection.cs` which will:
1. Replace the GetAllChromeTabs method to always return an empty collection
2. Add a debug menu option to enable/disable Chrome tabs

### STEP 4: ADD TIMEOUT PROTECTION
The updated code includes:
1. Timeout protection for all UI Automation operations
2. Global timeout for LoadData to prevent application hanging
3. Improved error handling with detailed logging
4. Performance timing for all operations

### STEP 5: TEST THE FIX
1. Run the application with these changes
2. Check the log file (located in %LOCALAPPDATA%\TaskSwitcher\Logs)
3. Initially, leave Chrome tab detection disabled
4. If the application works well, you can try enabling Chrome tabs using the debug menu

### ADVANCED FIX (IF NEEDED)
If you want to properly fix the Chrome tab detection rather than disabling it:
1. Implement the code in `ChromeTabAutomation.cs` with its timeout protections
2. Consider using Chrome's debugging protocol instead of UI Automation
3. Try a more limited approach that only detects active tabs, not all tabs

### LOG FILE LOCATION
The logs are written to: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\TaskSwitcher\Logs\TaskSwitcher_yyyy-MM-dd.log`

Check these logs to understand exactly where the application is hanging and what operations are taking too long.
